Here are some of the most popular and essential Git commands:


git clone <repository-url>
Creates a complete local copy of a remote repository (including all history and branches).

git init
Initializes a new Git repository in the current directory.

git status
Shows the current state of your working directory and staging area (which files are modified, staged, or untracked).

git add <file> (or git add . / git add -A) 
Stages changes (adds them to the index) so they will be included in the next commit.

git commit -m "message"
Records the staged changes as a new commit in the local repository with a descriptive message.

git pull
Fetches the latest changes from the remote repository and automatically merges them into your current branch.

git push (often git push origin <branch>) 
Uploads your local commits to the remote repository.

git branch
Lists all local branches (with * showing the current one); can also create or delete branches with options.

git checkout <branch> (or modern git switch <branch>) 
Switches your working directory to another existing branch.

git checkout -b <new-branch> (or git switch -c <new-branch>) 
Creates a new branch and immediately switches to it.

git merge <branch>
Merges the changes from the specified branch into your current branch.

git log
Displays the commit history of the current branch (who, when, and what was changed).

git diff
Shows the differences between your working directory and the staging area (or between commits/branches).

git fetch
Downloads the latest commits, branches, and tags from the remote repository without merging them.

git stash
Temporarily saves your uncommitted changes so you can switch branches or pull cleanly, then re-apply them later.

These 15 commands cover ~90% of what most developers use daily. Mastering them will handle most common workflows like cloning projects, making changes, collaborating, and syncing with remotes.
